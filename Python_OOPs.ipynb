        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm that models real-world entities using objects and classes.\n",
        "- It emphasizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to make code modular, reusable, and maintainable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with data and behavior defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- | Concept           | Meaning                                              | Example                         |\n",
        "| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n",
        "| **Abstraction**   | Hides complex details, exposes functionality         | `abstract class Shape`          |\n",
        "| **Encapsulation** | Hides internal data, protects it from outside access | `self.__balance` in BankAccount |\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (double underscore methods) are special methods like __init__, __str__, __repr__ that define object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance allows a child class to acquire attributes and methods of a parent class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows one interface to have multiple forms. Methods with the same name behave differently in different classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation is done by making attributes private (prefix __) and using getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor (__init__) initializes an object’s attributes when it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class method (@classmethod): works with the class, not instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Static method (@staticmethod): independent of class or instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Method overloading in Python means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters\n",
        "- Python does not support true method overloading. We can simulate it using default arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- When a child class provides a new implementation of a parent class method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- @property allows methods to be accessed like attributes, supporting encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows flexibility and code reusability. It enables writing generic code that works with objects of different types.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class cannot be instantiated and usually contains abstract methods using the ABC module.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Reusability through inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation for data protection\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity and maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism for flexibility\n",
        "\n",
        "- Real-world modeling\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: shared by all objects\n",
        "\n",
        "- Instance variable: unique to each object\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- A class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__: human-readable string for end users\n",
        "\n",
        "- __repr__: developer-friendly string for debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- super() allows calling parent class methods, useful in inheritance and overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- __del__ is the destructor, called when an object is deleted or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod: no access to class or instance\n",
        "\n",
        "- @classmethod: has access to class (via cls)\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Child classes can override parent methods, so a parent class reference can point to multiple child objects, calling the appropriate method.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Calling multiple methods on the same object in one line by returning self.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- Allows an object to be called like a function."
